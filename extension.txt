Problem:
Wanted to print out mutual friends.

Solved:
Created a similar graph to actors, but I knew I had a pair of users for each
data entry. Therefore, I wanted to implement something using mutual friends.
I created individual UserNodes for each user and added a list of friends to
each user.

Tested:
I used the provided facebook file from SocialNetworks as my data set. Then, I
conjured up some user relationships (like users 0 and 1). I read that file as
my input file and printed out mutual friend relationships for each.

How to run:
Call make extension to compile.
USAGE: ./extension dataset_file(facebook_1000) user_pairs.tsv output.tsv

It reads in the dataset of friends. Then it prints out mutual friends for 
each pair in user_pairs.

Data Set Access:
The data set can be reached at /home/linux/ieng6/cs100w/public/pa4/SocialNetworks/data.

It uses the Facebook friends data sets in particular.
